⚡ Blinkit Admin Dashboard: Real-Time Commerce & Operations Monitoring

An intuitive, high-visibility analytics and management dashboard built for Blinkit’s internal teams to streamline performance tracking, customer management, inventory flow, and financial summaries.

## Short Description

The Blinkit Admin Dashboard is a visually organized and action-driven interface for managing core operational data across the Blinkit platform. Designed to offer real-time updates and easy navigation, it supports operations, inventory control, order tracking, and customer analytics—essential for fast-paced hyperlocal delivery environments.

## Tech Stack

The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:

• 📊 Power BI Desktop – Main data visualization platform used for report creation.

• 📂 Power Query – Data transformation and cleaning layer for reshaping and preparing the data.

• 🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for calculated measures, dynamic visuals, and conditional logic.

• 📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established among tables (resorts, snow, and data_dictionary) to enable cross-filtering and aggregation.

• 📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard previews.

## Business Problem

Blinkit operates in a fast-paced, high-volume hyperlocal delivery environment where real-time visibility into key operational metrics is essential. However, the absence of a centralized platform to monitor critical data—such as order statuses, inventory levels, customer activity, and financial performance—creates operational inefficiencies. This fragmentation leads to delays in identifying bottlenecks, hampers proactive decision-making, and reduces overall service responsiveness.

## Goal of the Dashboard

The goal of the Blinkit Admin Dashboard is to provide a visually structured, data-driven, and user-friendly interface that enables Blinkit’s internal teams to efficiently monitor and manage business operations in real time. Specifically, the dashboard is designed to:

- Centralize key performance indicators (KPIs) such as revenue, profit, total orders, and pending deliveries into a cohesive top-level summary for instant visibility.

- Support day-to-day operational workflows by providing detailed views of individual orders, their delivery status, payment methods, and associated customer profiles.

- Improve inventory oversight through a streamlined product management section that allows users to track product availability, pricing, and perform direct actions like editing or deleting items.

- Enhance customer relationship management by presenting high-value customer data, such as order frequency and total revenue contribution, in an accessible format.

- Facilitate proactive decision-making by surfacing critical information (e.g., payment pending, low stock) and reducing the need for cross-platform data gathering.

- Enable seamless navigation across modules (Dashboard, Orders, Products, Customers, Transactions) via an intuitive sidebar menu for increased operational efficiency.

This dashboard serves as a single source of truth for Blinkit’s business operations team—empowering them to take faster, smarter, and more informed actions in a highly dynamic e-commerce environme
